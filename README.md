# BIGINT-IMPLEMENTATION-IN-CPP
The is to create a program which can simulate the basic operations like addition and subtraction on really long integers by best utilising the underlying architecture. It is similar to the functionality provided by the BigInt class in java. 


As the biggest data type in c/c++ is long long int and it can carry out
operations in the range - 9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 we
need a way to carry out basic operations having inputs of length and value bigger
than long long int for various purposes. so we need big int implementation for  doing operations on integers which are beyond the range in c/c++.

Objectives :
> The program should be able to take inputs of very big numbers, greater than 19
digits provided by long long int.
> The program should provide basic operation like addition and subtraction
> The output of the program should be precise and correct
